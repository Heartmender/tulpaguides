# Niichan's guide to proxying for your tulpa
## By Niichan <nibi@lavabit.com>

So, you want to proxy for your tulpa, eh? Let's start with the definition of 
"proxy" as far as Google has it.

Proxy (noun):

1. The authority to represent someone else, esp. in voting.
2. A person authorized to act on behalf of another.
Synonyms: deputy, representative, agent, substitute

In terms of tulpamancery, we define the act of proxying as listening for and 
repeating your tulpa's input to somewhere else. This can be typed, vocal, 
artistic, or anything else I can't think of off the top of my head.

Proxying in a single line is a very easy concept, but some people have trouble 
with listening for and fully understanding their tulpa's input. One of the main 
problems that I've had with Yt and Quora is that sometimes I think too loudly. 
Think about it as an audio mixer in your head with one channel dedicated to you 
and other/s to your tulpa/e. You need to turn your thought-volume down slightly 
and turn up the thought-volume of the tulpa you want to proxy for. Then all you 
need to do is relax a bit and type or speak what they say.

Initially, when you start doing a lot of proxying for them, there's a high 
chance that they'll send more unprocessed thoughts when they're making 
analogies and the like. If you're not sure what they mean or are saying, feel 
free to ask them what they mean and send back the thought to them.

This gets much, much easier over time, but initially it does feel kind of 
discouraging. Keep at it and you'll be transparently proxying for them in no 
time whatsoever.
